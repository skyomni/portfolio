### Projects
##1. CubeSat Environmental Sensing System
Lead Builder • Embedded Systems Developer • Independent Research Project
#####Overview
Designed and built a custom CubeSat-style sensing platform to analyze how atmospheric conditions vary across building floors, with the goal of improving large-building HVAC efficiency.
#####Key Contributions

Engineered the CubeSat frame and integrated a BMP280 barometric pressure sensor and MPU6050 IMU/temperature sensor.

Programmed microcontroller firmware for continuous pressure, temperature, and acceleration data logging.

Conducted multi-floor flight tests inside a multi-story building to capture altitude-derived pressure changes.

Processed and graphed data in Python; identified temperature–pressure correlations relevant to HVAC load patterns.

Authored and analyzed findings for the research paper “Investigating Altitudinal Variations in Indoor Temperature Using CubeSat Pressure Data.”
