# Welcome to My GitHub Page

This repository serves as the source for my personal GitHub Pages site. Below you’ll find everything needed to navigate, understand, and extend the site.

## 📌 About This Site

This GitHub Pages website is built directly from this repository and showcases my projects, coursework, and creative work. It is designed for future scalability, clean organization, and easy navigation.

---

## 🧭 Sidebar Navigation (Planned Integration)

A collapsible sidebar navigation will soon be added to allow quick access to pages such as:

* **Home**
* **Projects**
* **Coursework**
* **Labs & Reports**
* **Blog / Notes**
* **Contact**

This will make the site easier to browse as more content is added.
