# Narrative: Telling the Story

## The Journey

Our project began with a simple question:

> How can we create an enjoyable, interactive experience using only a Pico kit?

This question led us through a journey of discovery and refinement:

### Phase 1: Exploration
Brainstorming multiple game ideas and exploring what was technically feasible with our available components.

### Phase 2: Individual Development
Building four unique prototypes, each team member taking ownership of a different game concept.

### Phase 3: Testing & Evaluation
Testing mechanics, wiring configurations, and gameplay experiences to identify the strongest concept.

### Phase 4: Selection & Refinement
Selecting the Light Reaction Game as our final concept based on its engaging gameplay and scalability.

### Phase 5: Engineering Excellence
Scaling and polishing the design into a final product with professional-grade enclosure and clean electronics.

## The Design Process

The project showcases our journey through the complete engineering design cycle:

**Creativity** → **Prototype** → **Engineering Refinement** → **Final Product**

Through iterations, collaboration, and structured problem-solving, we transformed simple components into an engaging arcade experience.

## Key Takeaways

This project demonstrated that successful engineering is not about getting it right the first time—it's about:
- Iterating based on feedback
- Learning from failures
- Collaborating effectively
- Documenting thoroughly
- Refining continuously

Our final product represents not just a game, but a testament to the power of the engineering design process.
