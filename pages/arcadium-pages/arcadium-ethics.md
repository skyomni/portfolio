# Ethical Considerations: Technology & Society

## Values Guiding Our Project

**Accessibility**: Creating a low-cost entertainment device that can be replicated with minimal resources

**Transparency**: Using acrylic panels to reveal internal components and promote understanding of electronics

**Education**: Demonstrating basic electronics concepts in an engaging, hands-on format

---

## New Form of Life (Using Technology Practice Chart)

Our project promotes:
- **Hands-on Interaction**: Direct physical engagement with technology
- **Quick Reflex Development**: Cognitive skill building through gameplay
- **Educational Exposure**: Introduction to embedded systems and programming
- **Community Building**: Creating a playful, community-friendly environment

## Life-Cycle Analysis

### Production Impact

**Prototyping Phase:**
- Produced 4 prototypes, discarding earlier cardboard versions
- Generated material waste during iteration process

**Final Construction:**
- Laser-cut wood requires energy consumption and material waste
- Cardboard templates generated scrap materials

### Supply Chain Considerations

**Component Sources:**
- Components (Pico, LEDs, LCD) rely on global supply chains
- Raspberry Pi microcontrollers depend on silicon mined overseas
- Metals for wiring and soldering have environmental extraction costs

### End-of-Life Considerations

**Disposal Challenges:**
- Electronics must be properly e-waste recycled
- Mixed materials (wood, electronics, acrylic) complicate recycling
- Wood enclosure could be reused or repurposed for other projects

**Sustainable Practices:**
- Design for disassembly to enable component reuse
- Use recyclable materials where possible
- Document construction for future repairs and modifications

## Broader Impact Questions

**Who Benefits?**
- Students learning electronics
- Community members seeking entertainment
- Future makers using our documentation

**Who Bears the Cost?**
- Communities affected by electronics mining
- Workers in global supply chains
- Environment through resource extraction

**Future Considerations:**
- How can we design for longer product lifespans?
- Can we source components more ethically?
- How do we balance innovation with environmental responsibility?
