## Peer Feedback

Peers and instructors recommended:
- Increasing the responsiveness of the buttons on the User Interface
- Changing the type of Raspberry Pi for there to be enough GPIO pins for all the components
- Adding game instructions on the side panel

These recommendations helped us refine:
- Overall usability
- Visual appeal
- User experience
- Structural integrity
