# Introduction

This project focuses on designing and developing an interactive arcade-style game using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. As part of a team of four, my group explored various game concepts before selecting a final design to refine into a polished prototype.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice the engineering design process—from ideation, prototyping, CAD modeling, programming, and enclosure design, all the way to a documented final build.

## Key Constraints

- Limited space inside the enclosure
- Physical size of breadboards and wires
- Material availability
- Functionality requirements tied to the Pico component kit

## Project Evolution

Throughout the quarter, we iterated through multiple prototype versions, evaluated functionality, and carefully improved:
- User experience
- Wiring layout
- Mechanics

Our final concept originated from Dabian's "Light Reaction Game," which we expanded by:
- Improving enclosure design
- Reorganizing wiring
- Scaling the structure
- Proposing the addition of a candy dispenser to increase user engagement
