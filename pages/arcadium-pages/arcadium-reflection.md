# Personal Reflections

## Skills Developed

This project improved my engineering skills in:
- CAD modeling and technical drawing
- 3D Modeling with Rhino
- Breadboard & Pico wiring techniques
- Flowcharting and game logic design
- Laser-cut enclosure design
- Team communication and collaboration
- Project documentation

---

## What I Would Do Differently

If I were to do it again, I would:
- Start enclosure CAD modeling earlier in the process
- Explore more 3D printing for complex internal parts
- Change the Raspberry Pi Board for a more complex board with more GPIO pins
- Allocate more time for testing and refinement

## My Specific Contributions

**Individual Work:**
- Developed the Flappy Bird prototype
- Built CAD layouts for my prototype
- 3D modeled and printed a custom part for the Micro Servo
- Built and CAD-designed the Candy Dispenser

**Team Collaboration:**
- Assisted in redesigning the final enclosure
- Participated in wiring and materials planning
- Helped evaluate final design constraints
- Contributed to the group decision-making process

## Project Impact

This project demonstrated the importance of:
- Iterative design processes
- Clear documentation
- Team communication
- Technical precision
- User-centered design thinking

The experience reinforced that successful engineering requires balancing creativity with practical constraints.
