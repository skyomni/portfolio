# Challenges & Solutions

## Challenge 1: Breadboard Size

**Problem**: The breadboard was too large for a compact enclosure.

**Solution**: Obtained a mini breadboard and redesigned cutouts based on caliper measurements.

---

## Challenge 2: Wire Clutter

**Problem**: Wires interfered with gameplay and LCD visibility.

**Solution**: Introduced flat cables and internal shelves to vertically separate components.

---

## Challenge 3: Candy Dispenser

**Problem**: The automatic candy dispenser required a lever-like attachment to the Micro Servo SG-90

**Solution**: Had to 3d design and print a custom lever part that would attach/fit into the Micro Servo SG-90

---

## Challenge 4: Not enough independent GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico for all the components

**Problem**: The Raspberry Pi Pico did not provide enough independent pins for us to use all 16 LEDs with a servo and an LCD screen

**Solution**: Had to disable 4 of the LED connectors to use the Micro servo and LCD screen
