# Define the Problem

Our initial challenge was to create a fun, portable, and interactive entertainment device using the Raspberry Pi Pico and the components in the provided kit. We were tasked with designing an arcade-style game enclosure that balances usability, compactness, and clean electronic integration.

## Identified Issues

Early problem-framing sessions highlighted several challenges:

- **Breadboard Size**: Breadboards were too large for compact arrangements
- **Display Limitations**: LCD screens were small, impacting visual usability
- **Wiring Clutter**: Wiring often became cluttered and interfered with gameplay
- **Structural Integrity**: Cardboard prototypes lacked structural integrity
- **Component Placement**: Components such as buttons and LEDs required ergonomic placement

## Brainstorming Session (10/28)

During brainstorming, we evaluated the following game concepts:

1. Doodle Jump
2. Tempo Game
3. Piano Tiles
4. Ball Drop
5. Flappy Bird
6. Light Reaction Game

Each concept was assessed for:
- Hardware feasibility
- Gameplay logic
- Enclosure constraints

> **Note**: Early sketches and brainstorming notes are available in the project documentation.
