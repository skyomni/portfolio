# Document Your Process

## Major Milestones

### ✔ 10/28 — Brainstorming & Selecting Game Concepts

We generated multiple game ideas and selected one per person to prototype individually. I chose Flappy Bird, focusing on programming logic and enclosure rough layout. We documented:
- Materials needed
- Wiring concepts
- CAD requirements

### ✔ 11/4 — Individual Prototypes Completed

Each member created cardboard prototypes and functioning game logic:

**Components:**
- Fully wired cardboard enclosure
- LCD display integration
- Flowcharts and pseudocode
- CAD drawings for enclosure layout

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Breadboard too large → Considered mini breadboards
- Wires messy → Looked into flat cables
- Button placement ergonomics unclear → Adjusted in CAD

### ✔ 11/18 — Final Project Selection & Improvements Planning

The team chose Dabian's Light Reaction Game to finalize because:
- It was fun, fast-paced, and programmable
- It had the clearest pathway for feature expansion
- It integrated components evenly across the kit
- It met most requirements of the project

**Identified Improvements:**
- Larger final enclosure
- Better wire management
- Cleaner component alignment
- Adding a candy dispenser
- Using acrylic windows to show wiring

## Meeting Notes

Key decisions from team meetings:
- Consider using two Picos if needed
- Add shelves or layers inside to separate components
- Use wood as the final material
- Explore larger LCD options
