# Explore Iterations

The project evolved significantly through multiple iterations, each improving upon the previous design.

## Iteration 1 — Individual Prototypes

Each member built a full game prototype using cardboard. My Flappy Bird game required:
- LCD updates for player motion
- Button press debouncing
- Timing logic for obstacles
- CAD layout for screen + button alignment

## Iteration 2 — Refining Mechanics

We tested gameplay reliability, ensuring:
- Button responsiveness
- LED timing accuracy
- Consistent program behavior
- Stable game loops

## Iteration 3 — Group Final Concept Selection

We chose the Light Reaction Game because:
- Simple to showcase and demonstrate
- Allowed effective use of LEDs, buttons, and Pico logic
- Scaled well with enclosure redesign
- Engaging gameplay mechanics

## Iteration 4 — Structural & Material Improvements

We redesigned the enclosure using:
- **Wood** as the final material for stability
- **Acrylic windows** to showcase internal wiring
- **Internal shelves** for modular electronics organization
- **Precise laser cutting** for clean assembly

## What Didn't Work

- **Breadboard Size**: Too large for original design → Had to redesign enclosure
- **Wire Management**: Initial wiring easily tangled → Switched to neater routing
- **Button Spacing**: Buttons too close together → Repositioned in CAD

## What Worked

- **Laser Cutting**: Gave precise and stable structure
- **Flowchart Logic**: Guided clean programming approach
- **Internal Shelves**: Reduced wire clutter significantly
- **Material Choice**: Wood provided necessary durability
