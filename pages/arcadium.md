# 🎮 ARCADIUM: Arcade-Style Game Prototype & Final Group Project

An interactive arcade-style game designed and developed using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller as part of a team engineering project.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores the engineering design process—from ideation and prototyping to CAD modeling, programming, and enclosure design. Our team of four developed multiple game concepts before selecting and refining a final design into a polished prototype.
